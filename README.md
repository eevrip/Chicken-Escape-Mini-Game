# CHICKEN ESCAPE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
=================================

Our team consisting of two people developed a low-poly, third person, infinite runner game with a chicken
as the main player. Our protagonist has successfully escaped their coop and now they are on a mission to
rescue their chicken friends from other coops. Along the road they must avoid obstacles that make them
dizzy and unable to continue the mission. In addition, our hero must collect fruits to keep them motivated
and have enough strength to complete the mission. Most importantly they must collect golden eggs in order
to find the key to rescue their chicken friends. This game was developed in Unity using free assets, while the
main character mesh and animation was created in Blender.

A game developed as a project for the course: Computer Games Software Technology.
